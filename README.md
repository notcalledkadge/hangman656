## Description
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. There is also a bonus game avaliable. Should you decide that Hangman is a little too basic for your tastes, please choose option '2' during initialisation.
The aim of this project is to highlight what I have learnt during this course, as well as allow me to look into more complex ideas.
