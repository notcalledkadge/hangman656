# Project: Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. In this version, you have 5 lives.
There is also a bonus text adventure listed here that was a side project of mine.

## File Structure
- Milestone_2: Some simply-constructed variables and functions that were important in the process of creating Hangman.
- Milestone_3: Using the basics from Milestone_2, and growing from there.
- Milestone_4: Building ver_1 of Hangman. Using the foundations of the variables and functions that I built previously and making a working item.
- Milestone_5: Built the logic of Hangman. Ensured that the player has as many tries as they do lives/life. Defined a new list of words based on a list of character names. Quality of life improvements, making 'lives' change to 'life' when the user reaches 1, printing the empty spaces at the start of the game.
- Text Adventure.

## Description
The aim of this project was to take everything that I had learnt during this course and build a version of the Hangman game using it. The biggest hurdle that I had to overcome was formatting of different functions. The amount of times that I had a infinitely-running While loop was hilarious. Using online resources, the course's resources and some books that I was able to find online, I have been able to produce a game that runs, and works well.
