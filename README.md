# Project: Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. In this version, you have 5 lives. The completed game is avaliable in Milestone_5. Just run the code with the play_game() command that is created and listed there.

## File Structure
- Milestone_2: Some simply-constructed variables and functions that were important in the process of creating Hangman.
- Milestone_3: Using the basics from Milestone_2, and growing from there.
- Milestone_4: Building ver_1 of Hangman. Using the foundations of the variables and functions that I built previously and making a working item.
- Milestone_5: Built the logic of Hangman. Ensured that the player has as many tries as they do lives/life. Defined a new list of words taken from a list of names from a famous series. Various quality of life improvements: making 'lives' change to 'life' when the user reaches 1, printing the empty spaces at the start of the game, etc.

## Description
The aim of this project was to take everything that I had learnt during this course and build a version of the Hangman game using it. The biggest hurdle that I had to overcome was formatting of different functions. The amount of times that I had a infinitely-running While loop was hilarious. Using online resources, the course's resources and some books that I was able to find online, I have been able to produce a game that runs, and works well.

## Installation Instructions
Plug and play. Run the code and enjoy yourself!
In the terminal or command prompt, use the command "python /path/to/your/script.py" (replace "/path/to/your/" with the actual path to your script). This allows you to execute the Python Script from any location, providing the full path for direct access!

## Licensing information
This code was built using Python, an open-sourced environment. The code itself is also open source. Take a copy. Improve it. Most importantly, have fun!
