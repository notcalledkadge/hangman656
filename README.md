# Project: Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. There is also a bonus text adventure game available.
